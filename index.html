                <p class="mediacontent">For my first design, I placed a large red hot air balloon on a soft blue background. These colours create a stark contract and draw the eyes towards the poster. The viewer eye is then drawn towards the title placed upon the distinct red. I have aligned the hot air balloon in the centre of the page. This lets the viewer know the theme of the event without yet reading the information. I have aligned text to the right of the balloon, however I have placed the sponsors to the left of the balloon in order to create a sense of balance. Repetition has been created by the repeating white clouds behind the balloon. The proximity of the text on the right is important in reference to the balloon, therefore, I have creates a cascading structure, meaning that each line of text has equal proximity to the balloon.</p>

            </div>


            <div class="media-container">
                
            <p class="mediacontent">For my second design I used a number of images to showcase what the balloon fiesta has to offer. I have created contrast using pink and blue tones. I have aligned the images to the left and the text to the right. The pink shape is inspired by the Bristol suspension bridge, I have aligned it to resemble the structure shape. Repetition is shown using multiple hot air balloons throughout the poster. The proximity of the text is arranged so that the important event information can be found together. The sponsors are all arrange in close proximity so that the viewer can easily find all the sponsors in one place.</p>

                <img class="carp-item" src="images/CARP-poster4-original.png" alt="a photo of cake">
            
                <p class="mediacontent">For my third design, I went for a simplistic, cartoon-like style. The orange and brown tones of the hot air balloons contrasts the pale toned clouds and sky. The smaller clouds on the left and right of the page are aligned in these positions to create symmetry and balance. Repetition can be seen in the hot air balloons as they rise from behind the clouds. The layered clouds at the bottom of the poster also present repetition. The proximity of the transitional style text to the clouds conveys the light, floating effect of the clouds.</p>

            Final Design
            <div class="carp-group">
                <img class="carp-item" src="images/CARP-poster4.png" alt="a photo of cake">
            
                <p class="carp-text caption">I decided to go with my third poster as my final design, however I felt that there was room for improvement on this poster. The first issue with this poster was that the viewers eye would initially be drawn to the event date instead of the event title. I believe this is because the event title text appears smaller that the event date text. As well as this, the colour of the event date text is more attention grabbing than the event title text. To fix this issue, I have changed the font and size of the text. I have increased the size of the event title text and changed it to a more eye-catching font. I have also designed a shadow effect behind the text to create a 3D effect. I also felt that there was a little bit too much blank space in the sky. To fix this issue I placed another small hit air balloon into the scene. I feel that these changed have improved my poster design. </p>

                <p class="worksheet-text caption">On HTML/CSS worksheet 2, I learnt how to create a HTML document using !DOCUTYPE. I also learnt about block level elements such as p, h and ol, and inline elements like strong, small and em. I learned how to add a link using a and how to add an image using img.  On worksheet 3 I learnt how to add and link a CSS file to my existing HTML file. I learnt how to style elements using the CSS file such as changing fonts, adding borders and adding padding. I learnt how to link multiple HTML sheets and how to add a second CSS stylesheet. I was also introduced to flexbox through this worksheet.

                <p class="worksheet-text caption">On worksheet 4, I created a new HTML/CSS document. On this worksheet I dived further into flexbox, learning flex grow, flex shrink and how to use flex box in menus. I introduced to embedding videos, audio and how to centre items using CSS. I learned how to arrange media items with corresponding text while using flexbox. I discovered how to create anchor links within a navigation bar, which allows me to skip to a particular part of the webpage. I continued to work on this document through worksheet 5. Here I learnt how to create buttons and style them using CSS. I learned how to add a footer to the bottom of the page. I learned how to add a second page and duplicate the first page to the new one. Finally, I learnt how to change the page colour scheme and add new webfonts using adobe and google fonts.
